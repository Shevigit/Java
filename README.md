# Inquiry Management System (Client-Server)

A complete **E2E Java system** consisting of two projects:  
- **Server:** `inquirymanagement_bsg`  
- **Client:** `clientside_bsg`  

The system demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, multithreading, and queue-based request management using data structures.

---

##  How to Run
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE).
2. Run the server project first: `inquirymanagement_bsg`.
3. Once the server is running, start the client project: `clientside_bsg`.
4. You can open multiple client instances simultaneously to test concurrency and load handling.

---

##  Technologies & Methodologies
- **Java (Pure Java)** – without external frameworks.
- **OOP** – SOLID principles and modular class design.
- **Multithreading** – handling multiple client requests in parallel.
- **Data Structures** – queues for managing incoming requests.
- **Agile** – iterative development, task breakdown, version control with Git.

---

##  Key Features
- Server listens and handles requests from multiple clients simultaneously.
- Queue-based system for efficient load management.
- Modular code separating server and client logic.
- Support for running multiple client instances in parallel.

---

##  Future Improvements
- Extend the client-server communication protocol.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for the client (JavaFX/Swing).
- Enhance logging and error handling.
